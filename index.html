            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Weather plays a crucial role in our daily lives, influencing everything 
                from agriculture and tourism to transportation and public health. Capital cities, 
                as political, economic, and cultural hubs, often shape national policies in areas 
                like urban planning, agriculture, and disaster preparedness. Their weather patterns 
                can represent broader regions, especially in countries where significant populations 
                live around the capital. This makes them valuable for studying national responses to 
                climate change and regional impacts. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset 
                of daily weather information from capital cities around the world, starting from August 2023. 
                With over 40 features—including temperature, wind, pressure, precipitation, humidity, 
                visibility, and air quality measurements—this dataset enables the exploration of global weather 
                trends and their relationships. By examining this data, we can uncover insights about climate 
                variability, identify regions most affected by climate change, and provide valuable information 
                for policymakers and the general public. Understanding these weather patterns can then help us 
                predict climate trends, prepare for extreme weather events, and mitigate potential impacts on society.

                To investigate recent weather trends and patterns on a global scale, we have decided to examine the World Weather Repository 
                dataset, which contains daily weather data for capital cities around the world, starting from August 2023. We have been able to 
                obtain the dataset through Kaggle as a CSV file that contains a single table with 41 columns and 28,147 rows. For a specific day, 
                there are 195 rows with weather condition measurements for capital cities of 195 countries around the world. This dataset provides 
                40+ features of the current weather and climate conditions globally, including crucial attributes that we are interested in such 
                as temperature, weather condition, amount of precipitation, humidity, UV index, as well as air quality metrics for carbon monoxide, 
                nitrogen oxide, PM 2.5, PM 10, sulfur dioxide, and the U.S. EPA air quality index. Most attributes of this dataset are quantitative 
                (including attributes such as temperature, amount of precipitation, humidity, air quality measurements etc.), as they are 
                measurements of different features of the weather in cities, however, there is still meaningful ordered (EPA air quality index, 
                UV index, GB DEFRA Index) and unordered categorical data (weather condition), as well as date/time data that are relevant to our analysis.
