    <h1> Global Weather Analysis: A Study of Capital Cities </h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Weather plays a crucial role in our daily lives, influencing everything 
      from agriculture and tourism to transportation and public health. Capital cities, 
      as political, economic, and cultural hubs, often shape national policies in areas 
      like urban planning, agriculture, and disaster preparedness. Their weather patterns 
      can represent broader regions, especially in countries where significant populations 
      live around the capital. This makes them valuable for studying national responses to 
      climate change and regional impacts. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset 
      of daily weather information from capital cities around the world, starting from August 2023. 
      With over 40 features—including temperature, wind, pressure, precipitation, humidity, 
      visibility, and air quality measurements—this dataset enables the exploration of global weather 
      trends and their relationships. By examining this data, we can uncover insights about climate 
      variability, identify regions most affected by climate change, and provide valuable information 
      for policymakers and the general public. Understanding these weather patterns can then help us 
      predict climate trends, prepare for extreme weather events, and mitigate potential impacts on society.

        and Weather Extremes: A review of Recent Findings. </a>
        Since climate data is collected across a large number of weather stations globally, it is important to 
        understand the complexities involved in estimating global temperatures through collecting large-scale data,
        as well as potential methodologies for correcting biases and ensuring the accuracy of climate trend analysis through

    <h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>

    <p>Data source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository">Global Weather Repository</a>
    </p>

    <p> To investigate recent weather trends and patterns on a global scale, we have decided to examine the World Weather Repository 
      dataset, which contains daily weather data for capital cities around the world, starting from August 2023. We have been able to 
      obtain the dataset through Kaggle as a CSV file that contains a single table with 41 columns and 28,147 rows. For a specific day, 
      there are 195 rows with weather condition measurements for capital cities of 195 countries around the world. This dataset provides 
      40+ features of the current weather and climate conditions globally, including crucial attributes that we are interested in such 
      as temperature, weather condition, amount of precipitation, humidity, UV index, as well as air quality metrics for carbon monoxide, 
      nitrogen oxide, PM 2.5, PM 10, sulfur dioxide, and the U.S. EPA air quality index. Most attributes of this dataset are quantitative 
      (including attributes such as temperature, amount of precipitation, humidity, air quality measurements etc.), as they are 
      measurements of different features of the weather in cities, however, there is still meaningful ordered (EPA air quality index, 
      UV index, GB DEFRA Index) and unordered categorical data (weather condition), as well as date/time data that are relevant to our analysis.

        <p>Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical 
            information is important when evaluating the unemployment
            rate. Therefore, we also make use of geographical information 
            on <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>. 
            The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US states. 
        </p>

        <p>To make a better data visualization, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii
            from the data. Following is an interactive map for the 
            lower 48 states in US. User can zoom in the map. The color
            indicates the unemployment rate for each state. When click any 
            state, other social factors will be revealed for the state. </p>

            <p>In general, west coast states tend to have higher 
                unemployment rate. On the east coast, West virginia 
                and New York state tend to have higher unemplyment rate
                than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
                are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.

        <h3>Air Quality - The Level of PM2.5 in Europe vs. Asia for different weather conditions</h3>
        
        <div class = 'container'>
            <svg id="airqualityplots"></svg>

            <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
            <script src="air_quality.js"></script>

            <svg id="temperatureplots"></svg>
            <script src="temperature.js"></script>

        </div>

        <p> The first bar plot demonstrates the level of PM2.5 in different weather conditions in capital
            cities of Asia and Europe. Overall, it is very clear that there is a distinguishable difference
            in the level of PM2.5- indicating a higher level of air pollution - across all weather types in
            Asia, compared to Europe. This pattern suggests that there is an uneven distribution of air pollution.
            We have chosen to visualize data from Asia versus Europe as according to the 
            <a href="https://epi.yale.edu/epi-results/2020/component/air">Environmental Performance Index</a>, which measures 
            the direct impacts of air pollution on human health in each country, 4 out of the top 5 countries with the best weather
            performance score are in Europe, while the 5 countries with the lowest index are in Asia, which further confirms the 
            pattern shown in the bar plot, where the levels of PM2.5 in capital cities in Asia are all higher than that in Europe.


            pollution levels in their capital cities can help assess the effectiveness of their climate policies and 
            push for stronger accountability in mitigating global climate effects.
