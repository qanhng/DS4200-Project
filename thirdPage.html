    <h1> Temperature and Air Quality Analysis in each continent </h1>

    <h2>Temperature vs. PM10 in cities where Air Quality Index is greater than or equal to 3</h2>
    <p>The analysis of the temperature and PM10 Air Quality Index (AQI) across cities in Asia, Europe,  Africa, and the Americas 
        reveals notable regional differences and trends. </p>

        <h3> Asia </h3>
        <p>In Asian cities, a positive correlation between temperature and PM10 AQI 
        is evident, with higher temperatures often coinciding with elevated AQI levels. Cities like Beijing Shi and New Delhi 
        stand out with significantly higher AQI values, reflecting the impacts of urbanization, industrial activity, and vehicular 
        emissions. The trend in Asian cities suggests that warmer temperatures might exacerbate pollution levels, possibly due to 
        increased photochemical reactions in urban areas.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Europe</h3>
        <p>In contrast to Asia, European cities such as Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris exhibit a narrower range of both temperature and 
            AQI values. While there is still a positive relationship between the two variables, the lower AQI levels compared to Asian 
            cities suggest better air quality management and stricter environmental regulations in Europe. The clustering of European cities 
            within a mid-temperature range reflects a more uniform climate across the region, with fewer extreme pollution events.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Africa</h3>
        <p>African cities, including Cairo, Nairobi, and Pretoria, display a more dispersed distribution of temperature and AQI values. 
            The broader range likely reflects the diverse climatic and environmental conditions across the continent. While some cities 
            maintain relatively low AQI levels, others show higher values, potentially due to localized factors like urban density, industrial 
            activity, and seasonal dust storms. Overall, the analysis highlights significant geographic variations in air quality trends, 
            with Asian cities facing more severe pollution challenges, Europe maintaining stricter air quality standards, and Africa experiencing 
            diverse air quality patterns driven by local conditions.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>America</h3>
        <p>In the South and North American cities plot, a significant clustering of data points is observed at lower PM10 AQI values (below 200) 
            across a temperature range of 15°C to 30°C, indicating relatively better air quality in many cities. However, a few cities, such as Lima, 
            exhibit extremely high AQI values exceeding 1,000, predominantly in the cooler temperature range (6°C to 12°C), suggesting localized 
            pollution challenges possibly influenced by atmospheric or topographical conditions. No clear correlation is evident between temperature 
            and AQI, highlighting that air quality is driven more by region-specific factors like urban density, industrial activities, and policy 
            measures. The analysis underscores significant variability across cities, with some regions facing severe air quality issues while others 
            maintain relatively low AQI</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>It’s also important to note that in the provided analysis of air quality trends above,  there are no Australian cities with a PM10 Air Quality Index (AQI) 
            below 3, hence no plot could be rendered. This absence suggests that Australian cities consistently maintain lower PM10 AQI values. Such an omission 
            highlights a potential area for further investigation, as Australia’s stringent environmental policies and its geographical isolation may contribute 
            to cleaner air compared to regions with higher urban and industrial densities. This insight could offer valuable context when comparing global air quality 
            trends and identifying best practices for pollution mitigation.</p>

    <h2>Air Quality - The Level of PM2.5 in Europe vs. Asia for different weather conditions</h2>
    <p> We have chosen to visualize data from Asia versus Europe as according to the 
        <a href="https://epi.yale.edu/epi-results/2020/component/air">Environmental Performance Index</a>, which measures 
        the direct impacts of air pollution on human health in each country, 4 out of the top 5 countries with the best weather
        performance score are in Europe, while the 5 countries with the lowest index are in Asia </p>

        <p> The first bar plot demonstrates the level of PM2.5 in different weather conditions in capital
            cities of Asia and Europe. Overall, it is very clear that there is a distinguishable difference
            in the level of PM2.5- indicating a higher level of air pollution - across all weather types in
            Asia, compared to Europe. This pattern suggests that there is an uneven distribution of air pollution.
            The pattern observed above between Asia and Europe confirms what the Environmental Performance Index shows, as
            the levels of PM2.5 in capital cities in Asia are all higher than that in Europe. The detailed look into each
            continent's and even countries' pollution levels in their capital cities can help assess the effectiveness of their climate 
            policies and push for stronger accountability in mitigating global climate effects.
            
    <h3> Next steps </h3>
    <p> As we have identified and analyzed general trends in temperature and air quality across the capital cities in different continents,
    we could focus on specific countries where air quality is very good or very bad, obtain data for every city, and visualize them to see
    the distribution of pollution across the country. It would also be helpful to calculate the median and interquartile range in temperature,
    air quality index, and other metrics for each country and compare them together using side-by-side box plots to see statistical significance. </p>
