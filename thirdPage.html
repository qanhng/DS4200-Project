            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Temperature vs. PM10 in cities where Air Quality Index is greater than or equal to 3</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The analysis of the temperature and PM10 Air Quality Index (AQI) across cities in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas 
                reveals notable regional differences and trends. </p>

            <div class="mb-6">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4"> Asia </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">In Asian cities, a positive correlation between temperature and PM10 AQI 
                is evident, with higher temperatures often coinciding with elevated AQI levels. Cities like Beijing Shi and New Delhi 
                stand out with significantly higher AQI values, reflecting the impacts of urbanization, industrial activity, and vehicular 
                emissions. The trend in Asian cities suggests that warmer temperatures might exacerbate pollution levels, possibly due to 
                increased photochemical reactions in urban areas.</p>

            <div class="mb-6">

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">In contrast to Asia, European cities such as Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris exhibit a narrower range of both temperature and 
                    AQI values. While there is still a positive relationship between the two variables, the lower AQI levels compared to Asian 
                    cities suggest better air quality management and stricter environmental regulations in Europe. The clustering of European cities 
                    within a mid-temperature range reflects a more uniform climate across the region, with fewer extreme pollution events.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">African cities, including Cairo, Nairobi, and Pretoria, display a more dispersed distribution of temperature and AQI values. 
                    The broader range likely reflects the diverse climatic and environmental conditions across the continent. While some cities 
                    maintain relatively low AQI levels, others show higher values, potentially due to localized factors like urban density, industrial 
                    activity, and seasonal dust storms. Overall, the analysis highlights significant geographic variations in air quality trends, 
                    with Asian cities facing more severe pollution challenges, Europe maintaining stricter air quality standards, and Africa experiencing 
                    diverse air quality patterns driven by local conditions.</p>

            <div class="mb-6">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">America</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">In the South and North American cities plot, a significant clustering of data points is observed at lower PM10 AQI values (below 200) 
                    across a temperature range of 15째C to 30째C, indicating relatively better air quality in many cities. However, a few cities, such as Lima, 
                    exhibit extremely high AQI values exceeding 1,000, predominantly in the cooler temperature range (6째C to 12째C), suggesting localized 
                    pollution challenges possibly influenced by atmospheric or topographical conditions. No clear correlation is evident between temperature 
                    and AQI, highlighting that air quality is driven more by region-specific factors like urban density, industrial activities, and policy 
                    measures. The analysis underscores significant variability across cities, with some regions facing severe air quality issues while others 
                    maintain relatively low AQI</p>

            </div>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">It's also important to note that in the provided analysis of air quality trends above,  there are no Australian cities with a PM10 Air Quality Index (AQI) 
                below 3, hence no plot could be rendered. This absence suggests that Australian cities consistently maintain lower PM10 AQI values. Such an omission 
                highlights a potential area for further investigation, as Australia's stringent environmental policies and its geographical isolation may contribute 
                to cleaner air compared to regions with higher urban and industrial densities. This insight could offer valuable context when comparing global air quality 
                trends and identifying best practices for pollution mitigation.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We have chosen to visualize data from Asia versus Europe as according to the 
            <a href="https://epi.yale.edu/epi-results/2020/component/air" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Environmental Performance Index</a>, which measures 
            the direct impacts of air pollution on human health in each country, 4 out of the top 5 countries with the best weather

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The first bar plot demonstrates the level of PM2.5 in different weather conditions in capital
                cities of Asia and Europe. Overall, it is very clear that there is a distinguishable difference
                in the level of PM2.5- indicating a higher level of air pollution - across all weather types in
                Asia, compared to Europe. This pattern suggests that there is an uneven distribution of air pollution.
                The pattern observed above between Asia and Europe confirms what the Environmental Performance Index shows, as
                the levels of PM2.5 in capital cities in Asia are all higher than that in Europe. The plot also suggests that fog and mist weather is when
                there is the highest level of PM2.5 in the air, which relates to the issue of air pollutants causing fog in many cities in Asia.
                The detailed look into each continent's and even countries' pollution levels in their capital cities can help assess the effectiveness of their climate 
                policies and push for stronger accountability in mitigating global climate effects.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Next Steps</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">As we have identified and analyzed general trends in temperature and air quality across the capital cities in different continents,
            we could focus on specific countries where air quality is very good or very bad, obtain data for every city, and visualize them to see
            the distribution of pollution across the country. It would also be helpful to calculate the median and interquartile range in temperature,
            air quality index, and other metrics for each country and compare them together using side-by-side box plots to see statistical significance.</p>
